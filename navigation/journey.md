## Journey

My CSP Journey

### Week 1
* During Week, I installed my Tools and Equipment which took the whole week due to numerous issues with not just my laptop but human error when it came to instllation. I didn't even aquire my laptop until the friday of that week! Once I did I had to disconnect the laptop from a non-existant adminstration accounts and domain to then later install the tools. The tools didnt end up taking that long to get once I got around to it, it was pretty easy, although I had some issues installing Unbuntu24.04 and needed asistance. 
### Week 2
* I began after getting my tools installed making my changes to my site. I first had some new text added for the about me page and then created a few new things such as a list, then asking to make it more complicated, so I created a new fade out list. I than also on my home page added the divs in order to create the sections that my buttons/"< a >" tags would go inside of. Following that I by recomendation of my teacher added Mario into my page with another addition of Bowser aswell. To finallize this part I then started logging my time within this page to record what was happening. Right after finishing the intiall log I then started to change this ups with SASS after using some basic styling within some buttons and < a > tags.
